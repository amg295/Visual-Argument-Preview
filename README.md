# Visual Argument Preview
My goal for this project is to show the negative effects of social media and framing it in terms of an addiction. In my preview the viewer can see that I am making these different apps into different drugs and showing true effects on users. My goal is to add more images and examples. Currently I am working with Gimp and the different tools so it has been a slow start. The different examples should in the end show repetition and different examples as one looks down the page. I am working with the selection tool mostly to modify these images, and I am also trying to work with color schemes. The current image is subject to change and will be added to for the final draft.
